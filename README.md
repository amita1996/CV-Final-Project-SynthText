# CV-Final-Project-SynthText

Final project of Introduction to Computer Vision course in the Open University.

The mission was to classify the font of each charcter that were inserted in the images synthetically using SynthText.

In my solution I used a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, Circle Loss, Voting and Warping.

In order to fully understand my solution please read the detailed PDF file.
